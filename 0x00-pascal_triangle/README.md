Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical construct named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although it was known in China and Persia centuries before Pascal's time. It's constructed by starting with a 1 at the top, then placing two 1s below it, and continuing to fill in rows below by summing adjacent numbers from the row above.

Here's an example of the first few rows:

   1
  1 1
 1 2 1
1 3 3 1

Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. For example, in the fourth row, the second number (3) is the sum of the two numbers above it in the third row (1 and 2). This pattern continues indefinitely.

Pascal's Triangle has many interesting properties and applications in mathematics, including:

Binomial Expansion: The coefficients of the expansion of (a + b)^n can be found in the nth row of Pascal's Triangle.

Combinations: The nth number in the mth row of Pascal's Triangle represents the number of ways to choose m items from a set of n items.

Fibonacci Sequence: The sums of the diagonals in Pascal's Triangle form the Fibonacci sequence.

Probability: Pascal's Triangle can be used to calculate probabilities in certain situations, especially those involving combinations and permutations.

Overall, Pascal's Triangle is a versatile tool in combinatorics and algebra, with applications ranging from probability theory to number theory and beyond.
